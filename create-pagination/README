# Description
We have a small app, it only has 3 pages.
There is a Posts page, that lists all 100 posts currently.

# Question
How would you alter the index.php file to make the page
paginate the posts to 10 per page?

# Other Info
Look to the public/index.php file, that is the whole app.
(It does of course leverage a library in the lib/ folder,
but thats not really important.)
